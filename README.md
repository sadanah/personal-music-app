# Music App
(for personal use)

# Why did I build this?

I was tired of using mainstream music apps that consume all my data and keeps playing adds every 5 seconds. 
I was also annoyed at how most apps don't support or need a subscription to pay music with the screen off.

# Improvements to be made:
- UI redesign
- Playback slider
- More customization options
- Folder / Aulbum feature
- Release .apk
- More specific file access permissions
<br>

# Usage

Feel free to use this for your own personal use! 

1. Currently working on the final .apk build, until then you can:
   <br>a. Fork the repo
   <br>b. Get it on your local machine
   <br>c. Build and run the project on your device
   
2. It plays music from your ``Internal Storage/Music/`` folder, so make sure to move your .mp3 files there.
   
3. Allow access to files (it only accesses your Music folder).

4. Enjoy your tunes!
